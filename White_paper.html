<h2>
  Abstract.
</h2>
<p>
  Monetary exchange of virtual cash and any other form of data transfer without
any trusted third party financial institution. Authentication of each transaction
shall be provided with the help of digital signatures. The list of all verified
transactions shall be available in public for everyone to see. The more common
proof of work method has been replaced by the Delegated Proof of Stakes method
where one doesn’t need to have a high end computing device to muscle through
the hashes. In this Proof of Stakes method anyone can add stakes and participate
in mining of blocks and henceforth verify it. It also provides a decentralised
storage facility where any node can opt to adhere to it. Thus, with the help
of this technology users can have endless possibilities when it comes to using a
decentralised storage facility.
</p>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>
<p>
  Decentralised currency is the solution to the current problem of mediary fund
transfer i.e transactions which are done by a financial institution as the medium.
This increases the cost of money/data transfer even for any casual case of
money/data transferring. We propose the blockchain technology to decentralise
and remove any third party for this purpose so that money/data transfer shall
take place directly. We propose Proof of Stakes to replace the previously existing
Proof of work. This will allow any user to be a miner without having to depend
on high computational power.
</p>

<h2>
  Address
</h2>
<p>
  Address is the unique identification of each user. Whenever a user joins a network,
it is allotted a signing key which is uniquely generated by the use of Elliptic
Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. After this the user’s address is generated by
double-hashing the verifying key generated from the allotted signing key. The
double hashing is achieved through Passing the verifying key through SHA256
and repassing it through ripemd160.
</p>

<h2>
  Transactions
</h2>
<img style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px auto;" src="img/transaction.jpeg" alt="">
<p>
  Transactions here does not only mean the transfer of coins from one address to
the another but refers to any kind of data map to be stored in blockchain. A
transaction can be created from any data transfer. The creation of transaction
object makes use of various hashing technologies to its core. Each user signs the
transaction to be created with its unique and private signing key to verify the
transaction. A non-reversible unique hash is allotted to each transaction
using a secured hashing algorithm, which acts as an identifier for each
transaction created. This creation of hash takes in account of all important
information from the transaction being created and hence making all those
information immutable after it is verified and finally stored in blockchain (As
any change in the data will lead to change of hash of the transaction and thus
deeming it void).
Each transaction can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Inputs here are
some of the previous outputs that were accounted to the address that is creating
the present transaction. And outputs are the location or addresses where the
object is being transferred. The problem that might come in the way is multiple
creation of transactions by using some already used outputs as inputs. To solve
this we use the most common and trusted approach. We include the hash of the
previous transaction that was created with outputs to the address creating the
present transaction along with signing script of that transaction. Therefore, this
approach aims to eliminate the fraud transactions to none, and thereby solving
most of the problems of centralised ecosystems.
</p>

<h2>
  The block and blockchain
</h2>
<img style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px auto 20px;" src="img/blockchain.jpeg" alt="">
<p>
  The blockchain comprises of individual blocks which includes multiple transactions. Every block has a hash, which acts as its unique identifier. Each block is
connected to the previous block by storing the hash of previous block. Every
block also has a unique merkle root which is based on the hashes of all the
transaction it comprises of. This merkle root changes if any of the transaction
inside the block is tampered and hence providing a secure storage of transaction
data in the blockchain. The height of block refers to the index of block in
the blockchain and its size in bytes is stored as its size. This core concept of
blockchain ensures immutability of data inside it.
</p>

<h2>
  DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake)
</h2>
<p>
  The double spending problem is solved using DPOS. To choose which nodes
adds the final block to the blockchain we use the algorithm of Delegated Proof
of Stake. In this system, ten super delegates are chosen who are allowed to
mine and add the final block. The nodes mining the blocks is also referred to as
miners.
In the concept of DPOS, each node provides some amount to the provided
election fund address in the form of transaction which is irreversible unless a
node opts out of the election process. Then each node places a vote to some other
node among the nodes standing in election. No node can vote for itself. After
all the votes have been made, the top ten delegates are chosen as miners to mine
and add the final block. The voting of a node is achieved through probability
random selection mechanism of node from the nodes opting to stake in election.
</p>

<h2>
  Mining
</h2>
<p>
  Not the conventional process as discussed earlier but rather meant to be used by
  anyone or everyone. After the ten super delegates are chosen, they are allowed to
  mine the blockchain and add the final block. Two main steps of mining includes
  the verification of all the transactions in the new block to be added and full
  blockchain verification. These verifications aim to remove any false transactions
  that might have been added somewhere in blockchain, if at all.
</p>

<h2>
  Transaction verification
</h2>
<p>
  The transaction is verification means verifying if
the input of this transaction is a valid output of some transaction in any block
of blockchain. This scans the blockchain and finds a match for the previous
transaction hash of the present transaction. The transaction verification process
is however technically different for different type of transactions.
</p>
 
<h2>
  Full blockchain verification
</h2>
<p>
  This process is the second step in the mining
  process. Here the complete blockchain is traversed through and verified if the
  merkle root is valid, which would otherwise not be, if any data inside a block is
  tampered.
</p>

<h2>
  Reward
</h2>
<p>
  A reward is received by the super delegates who finally mines the blockchain
and adds the new block to it. The reward is in the form of the digital currency
integrated with the blockchain. This reward is automated to the super delegates
till the maximum digital currency limit is reached. In this blockchain platform
there is no advantage of high CPU or GPU computation since the choosing
of super delegates is based on random probability algorithm. This hence
adds a reason for the rising of more and more nodes or servers of this
blockchain and hence making a completely decentralised environment.
</p>
<h2>
  51% consensus
</h2>
<p>
  This concept is based on the fact that any decision would be valid if 51%
consensus is reached. Therefore the most important requirement is that true
nodes form the majority of the blockchain for its proper and visioned functioning
rather than deviating and moving off track.
This consensus is more specifically used during data sync between different nodes
in the network and when the block mined by all ten super delegates is not the
same.
</p>

<h2>
  Network
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Each node in the network is on direct sync and communication with each
    other.
  </li>
  <li>
    RPC forms an important process in each node which is to communicate
    with external applications like explorer or wallet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each node has multiple processes listening/broadcasting simultaneously for its
    proper functioning.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a node receives a transaction, it stores in its own memory pool and the
    broadcast it to all other nodes, so that there are same transactions in every one’s
    memory pool.
  </li>
  <li>
    A node communicates with other nodes using UDP and TCP protocols.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each new block that miners/super-delegates add to the blockchain after mining
is completed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The receiver nodes or non super-delegates receives all blocks and adds the
most common block to its local blockchain (by 51% consensus).
  </li>
  <li>
    The difference in blockchains of different nodes, if at all is removed via
blockchain sync with 51% consensus system.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Hence, this forms a highly synced network with high speed unbarred communication between each node. Since all processes run simultaneously on each node,
  a process is not affected by other processes running on that node.
</p>
<h2>
  Proposal for Trucoin upgrades
</h2>
<p>
  Being open source, all the proposals for trucoin would also be decided by 51%
  consensus, i.e., a proposal would be integrated and remain valid as soon as it is
  accepted by majority of the nodes in the network.
</p>
<h2>
  Storage
</h2>
<img style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px auto;" src="img/storage.jpeg" alt="Storage">
<h2>
  Privacy
</h2>
<p>
  The conventional way involves trusted third parties as intermediaries while a
  transaction is taking place, but here this privacy is maintained by publicising
  all the transactions taking place without information linking the transaction to
  anyone. A new key pair is used for every transaction to provide anonymity to
  the owner of a key, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to that
  particular owner.
  The storage facility that we provide is a decentralised facility which ensures
  absolute privacy to the users who upload file using that thread.
</p>

<h2>
  Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
  Trucoin thus provides a vast platform for decentralised usage, tailored for
  tomorrow. This blockchain has its own digital currency as referred to by the
  name trucoin itself. There would not be any more need to rely on any kind
  of central authority for creating any kind of transaction. And as mentioned
  above this transaction just refers to transfer of any kind of data between two
  individuals. Digital currency and storing files securely are the most common
  usage. The possibilities of trucoin is endless. Almost any application can turn
  decentralised on integrating it with the blockchain. Trucoin would aim to solve
  most of the real life problems of by eliminating the factor of trust on any kind
  communication. The data immutability is the most important and core strength
  of any blockchain based technology. This would therefore power organisations
  or individuals to get away with the fear of data breach. The only requirement
  Trucoin would need is majority of honest nodes controlling the network through
  51% consensus.
